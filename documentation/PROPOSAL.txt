Proposal:

The proposal is to implement an LLVM-based compiler for the fun language (based on the specificaton
in p4), using the Scala programming language.

The compiler will implement the entirety of the language described in the original problem, as well as
adding additional common operators (like subtraction, division, etc), and will emit LLVM IR which can be
compiled using the LLVM linker/optimizer/compiler. The compiler will also implement some simple optimizations
on it's own, such as dead code elimination, loop unrolling, constant expression simplification, and so on.

Other optimizations will be added as we go along. If time allows, we'll do other neat things which are expected
of a compiler or a language.

Furthermore, we'll provide benchmarks and a decent selection of sample code in order to demonstrate any noticable
differences between the (very) naive p4 compilers and our optimized, LLVM-based compiler.

NOTE: Dr. Gheith approved this project for 3 people during office hours.
