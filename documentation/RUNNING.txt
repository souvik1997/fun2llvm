Explain why your supplied tests illustrate that your project works

        The tests which are included with this project can be found in the tests/ folder, and include all of the
        default tests used to check p4/p5, as well as several other tests created/provided by the team members.

        The default programs from p4/p5 (t0..t7) were used to check for basic correctness (by simply ensuring that
        the compiled program did indeed produce the expected values), and then the extra programs (ts0..tsa) were
        used to check some strange edge cases and to supplement the normal testing material.

        Considering that they all somehow pass, the compiler is indeed operable (and LLVM can produce some very optimized
        and tight assembly).
