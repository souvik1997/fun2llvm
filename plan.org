* Plan
1. Decide on a language (we chose C)
   1. Implement parser if not C
2. Learn LLVM, and things relevant to .fun (labels, functions, global/local variables, constants)
   1. Find relevant LLVM attributes/accessories
3. Print out appropriate LLVM code
4. Benchmarking

* Timeline
This week: pc
Next week: pd

Friday 4/22: have updated parser, understand LLVM (see above), reimplement p4 with LLVM
Saturday 4/23: Meet and hopefully wrap up
